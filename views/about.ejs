            <p>Hi, my name is Gabriel de Carvalho Beltr√£o Farias. I'm student of engineering, but I would like to be a full-stack developer. On my free time I enjoy playing video games, chess, studying and typing some code to get better at programming. I have dogs since I've been 3 years old, so I love dogs.</p>
